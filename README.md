# dt162g_projekt
CRUD app (MEVN stack) for course DT162G. By Nils Paulsson.

Run on localhost:

Download project and run through Node.js. Start client & server seperately. Server runs through node index.js (port 3000, server folder). Client runs on npm run serve (port 8080, client folder).

NOTE: The API uses Mongo Atlas storage by default, even on localhost. To change this, go to server/routes/api/posts.js line 101 (bottom of page).
